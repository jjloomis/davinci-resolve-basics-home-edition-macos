# Adding a dip to color dissolve

1. In the **Timeline**, zoom in on the area between the two clips upon which you'd like to add a cross dissolve. **Note**: Cross dissolves and other transitions appear very small in the **Timeline**, so it is of the utmost importance to zoom in.
2. Click the **Effects Library** tab \(upper-left.\)
3. If necessary, expand the **Toolbox** area \(upper-left\) to display transitions, titles, etc.
4. In the **Toolbox** area, select **Video Transitions**.
5. In the **Video Transitions** area, select **Dip to Color Dissolve**. 
6. Click and drag **Dip to Color Dissolve** into the **Timeline**. Be sure to place it between the clips where you'd like it to appear. 
7. By default, the **Dip to Color Dissolve** will appear white. To change the color to black \(the most common color used in a dip to color dissolve\), use the **Inspector** tab to customize the dissolve.
