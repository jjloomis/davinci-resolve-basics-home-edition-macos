# Downloading media files from YouTube to your project folder

1. Go to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) and find the video you want to add to your project. Copy the URL.
2. Go to [Offliberty](http://offliberty.com/). Paste the URL of the YouTube video in the empty field. Click the **Off** button \(this actually starts the process.\)
3. When Offliberty is done processing the YouTube video, Control-click within the **Right-click here and 'Save link as...** box. 
4. In the fly-out menu that appears, select **Save Link As** \(or **Download File As**, **Save Target As**, etc. This will vary depending on your browser.\)
5. In the Save As window, navigate to and select your project folder. Click **Save** to download the video file.
