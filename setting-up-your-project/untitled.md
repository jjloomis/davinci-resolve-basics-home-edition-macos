# Creating a project folder

Before starting a Resolve project, you'll need to create a project folder. All media files associated with your project will live in this project folder.

Never rename, move or delete the media files in your project folder. Your Resolve project file references these files. If Resolve file can't locate a media file, it will appear offline in your project.

1. On your Mac, navigate to your Documents folder.
2. Control-click in your Documents folder. In the fly-out menu, select New Folder.
3. Give this folder a new name. Follow [file and folder naming conventions](https://jjloomis.gitbook.io/file-and-folder-management/file-and-folder-naming-conventions).
